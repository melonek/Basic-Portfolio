<h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p1>My name is Piotr Babinski originally born in Poland. Lived there for 16 years
        before moving to Australia in 2007. I was lucky enough to visit my home country many times
        since I've moved. I had no trouble assimilatind with Australian culture and the way of living - I love it!
